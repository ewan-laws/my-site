title: "Why your next website should be built with Next.js"
---

Let's start with a (short) history lesson.

In the early days of the Web, life was simple, the websites were programmed by the web developer, who uploaded it to a server, which is served from the ... server, then finally presented to the user on the Web browser as-is, nothing changed.

But then we realised the power that could be tapped into if we allowed change to happen, so we made the server capable of modifying the content, this allows for things like Wikipedia, WordPress, Facebook, etc.

Unfortunately this transition from static to dynamic websites has its drawbacks:

# Time

Your customers are an fickle and impatient lot, if they're sitting there for over one second looking at a blank page, chances are you've lost them forever to their social media platform of choice. Website load times have been proven to have a large imapact on bounce rate.

# Security 

More complexity, more "moving parts" means more opportunities for the nefarious to potentially exploit your website and gain access to stuff they really shouldn't.

# Cost

Whereas once a servers job was to simply send a few files to the user, they now perform a large number of duties, including 

# Scalability

As the number of users to a website grows, its toll on resources grows quickly too, we need load balancing, caching, better hardware. These each introduce more complexity, more areas to maintain, more time spent by your team, more cost to the business.

How does Next.js come into play?

Fast forward to quite recently, and a new trend has appeared: *static website generation*. This allows us to take a specification of a website and build an old fashioned static website. Much like the old days, this can now be sent to the user using a "dumb" server.

If we want ourselves a blog, or simple marketing website this is perfect, its

But static generation can have some problems. Firstly every content change requires a rebuild, this can become computationally expensive. Imagine a complete rebuild of Facebook every time someone hit a like button on a page.

Next.js has a few tricks up its sleave to tackle these issues.
