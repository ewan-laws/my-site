I'm going to get this out of the way right away: I hate Jira. I've used it in my last two workplaces and I think its awful and I have a rather large grudge against it.
 
Why? Might you ask.

For those who use it or have used it, I think you know why.

For those who don't the UI is terrible, it's clunky, its slow, and its often buggy.

Thing is, Jira is powerful, perhaps even unriveled in its power, that's it's strengh, and ultimately it's downfall. Because the more something can do, the greater the requirement is for a fast, simple, and effective user interface. Jira in my opinion simply falls short of this.

If you become good enough with Jira and you can become employed as a "Jira Administrator". Now I want to focus on that for a bit, because something is *way* off.

A tool should exist to save money and/or time, businesses should not aspire to require tools that mean they need to hire a full time employee to work them.

What's worse is this introduces some subtler risks. Let me explain ...

In software development, with large unweildy projects it is good practice to get each member of a team working on as many of the different parts of the project as possible. That way, if someone gets hit by a bus (or less dramatically goes on holiday) the company doesn't lose all that knowledge in one fell swoop.

Maybe the company doesn't hire to admin Jira, but chances are one person at the company will blunder around figuring it out (i.e. wasting their time), perhaps going through some sort of training (i.e. wasting their time), then configuring the tool suitable for a specific business case.

This has the same problem, they might leave, then the company is essentially stuck with a mess of legacy systems, so really good luck if you want to configure it. At my last company the lead developer lost at least a day fixing the time logging integration.
