I'm going to get this out of the way right away: I hate Jira. I've used it in my last two workplaces and I think its awful and I have a rather large grudge against it.
 
Why? Might you ask.

For those who use it or have used it, I think you know why.

For those who don't the UI is terrible, it's clunky, its slow, and its often buggy.

## Power does not equate to useful

Thing is, Jira is powerful, perhaps even unriveled in its power, that's a strengh, but ultimately it's downfall. Because the more something can do, the greater the requirement is for a fast, simple, and effective user interface. Jira in my opinion simply falls short of this.

If you become good enough with Jira and you can become employed as a "Jira Administrator". Now I want to focus on that for a bit, because something is *way* off.

A tool should exist to save money and/or time, businesses should not aspire to require tools that mean they need to hire a full time employee to use them.

However this is a worse risk that one might not see at first, let me explain ...

In software development, it is good practice to get each member of a team working on as many of the different parts of a project as possible. That way, if someone suddenly exits the company those responsible for the project won't lose all that knowledge in one fell swoop. The sudden departure and loss of a key programmer instantly creates a whole bunch of legacy code that will take orders of magnitude more time and resources to work on. You might think "just document the code", sorry to be the bringer of bad news, but unless a professional is hired specifically to create the documentation, that just won't cut it.

Maybe the company doesn't hire to admin Jira, but chances are one person at the company will blunder around figuring it out (i.e. wasting their time), perhaps going through some sort of training (i.e. wasting their time), then configuring the tool suitable for a specific business case.

This has the same problem, they might leave, then the company is essentially stuck with a mess of legacy systems, so really good luck if you want to configure it. At my last company the lead developer lost at least a day fixing the time logging integration.
    
With software engineering there isn't much we can do to mitigate this issue except from knowledge sharing. But with the tools we pick we can and absolutely *must* choose those that do the job as well as possible and get out of the way as much as possible.

Any programmer worth their salt knows that they should constantly critically evaluate the technologies and choose those which are best fit for the job, managers should absolutely do the same.

## The Alternatives

So what are the alternatives? I'm glad you asked.
